list of currently connected players and the ability to change your nickname
Needs to be some way of all viewing the same sudoku, having it update in real time as other people insert things
Needs to not let you overwrite the starting numbers
ideally they would be bolded or easily identified
Nice to have would be an undo feature, different colors for different people's numbers
Autocheck the basic rules (if you put a 4 and there's already a 4 in that box/row)
- highlight squares where other people's cursors are
- navigate grid with arrow keys or HJKL
