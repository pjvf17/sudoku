# Bugs and Issues

- [ ] Naked single solver only supports the finding of one pair at a time
- [x] Sync serverside and clientside so that a blank cell is the same in both places
- [ ] Popup for new game shows up even when you finished the game
- [x] Fill in candidates not saving in server
- [x] Fill in candidates being pressed a second time erasing all candidates (24-07-2020)
- [x] Reloading doesn't work (? maybe?)
- [ ] Serverside validation is a bit wonky on reload sometimes
- [ ] Deno needs to be on for server, off for client
  - [ ] Fix by manually installing it? <https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=denoland.vscode-deno>
  - [ ] Another fix possible (13-05-2021) <https://deno.land/manual@v1.10.1/typescript/faqs#how-do-i-combine-deno-code-with-non-deno-code-in-my-ide>
  - [x] For now will just enable and disable extension as I switch between server and client (24-07-2020)
- [ ] Error message when server sends defocus for self
- [ ] If there are no hints available, it sends back the entire puzzle obj
- [ ] Naked pair sometimes comes up with a hidden pair
- [ ] SudokuObj possibly undefined PuzzleView.vue
- [x] Currently unable to switch tabs with puzzle open (14-05-2021)
- [x] Commenting out code that sets row & col to 5 in handeInput() causes errors, despite it being seemingly useless due to the cursor always starting at 1 (and what does that?) (14-05-2021)
  - Second piece, setting row & col = 1 is done in onConnection, main.ts
  - Caused type errors, changed type def in types.d.ts to not include the null possiblity, having been solved by onConnection setting the values
- [ ] Assigning null to User.focus.row/col error
  - Used for taking someone's cursor off the page if they're inactive
  - Fix by making an "active" switch that will hide a person's cursor if it's false
